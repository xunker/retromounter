# Enable a second SD card slot connected to SDIO interface.
# Using the SDIO interface instead of the slower SPI interface gives us about
# 10 times the read speed (>7MB/sec on a Pi Zero 1).
#
# `poll_once=off` is important because there is (as yet) no hardware support
# for the "Card Detect" pin on the slot, and so the Pi will poll the card
# periodically to see if one has been inserted. Without this directive, the
# system won't know when a card is inserted unless it is present at boot.
#
# IMPORTANT: on a Pi Zero 2, this will _DISABLE_ the onboard WiFi/Bluetooth.

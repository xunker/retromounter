============

Read and write retrocomputing disk images with ease using a Raspberry Pi or similar SBC, or even a
Linux PC.

IMPORTANT
---------

This is currently a proof-of-concept and breaking changes will happen often without advance notice
and without migration strategies.

Do not expect useful version numbers or a meaningful changelog for quite some time.
